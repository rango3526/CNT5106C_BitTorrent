Tasks:

Message builder / unbuilder
	- convert Length, Message Type, Payload into a byte array
	- convert from byte array to the individual pieces
Handshake message
	- pass in handshake info to message builder
Handle handshake
	- using info from received (unbuilt) handshake message, set variables and stuff
	- also check that the handshake header and peerID are correct
	- after handshake send bitfield
Connect to all other peers from Client.java
	- on startup try to connect to all peers (who have already started up)
	- once connected send handshake message
Listen for connections in Server.java
	- keep listening for connections
	- once connection received, receive and handle handshake
Read config files
	- read the config files and put the values into variables
	- have interface for other functions to find config values easily
Implement a neighbor handler
	- every p seconds reselect the preferred neighbors (those that send data at highest rate)
	- unchoke the neighbors it chooses, and choke the rest
	- handle "request" messages that come in after unchoking neighbors
	- 1 optimistically unchoked neighbor (reselected every m seconds)


Write bitfield builder/unbuilder
	- with existing info building bitfield (file that says which pieces I have)
	- deconstruct peer bitfields to see who has what
	- also keep track of all peer bitfields
Write filehandler
	- keeps track of all of the pieces I have and can put them together/take them apart
Send "have" messages to everyone when receiving new piece
	- whenever current bitfield is updated, send have messages to all neighbors
Write interest determining function
	- after receiving a "have" message, decide whether to send an "interested" message
Write choke determining function
	- decide who to send choke messages to
Write structure for piece messages
	- determine format of a piece message (how big is it, etc)
Write request determining function
	- who to send request messages to
	- only request a piece from one peer (don't request the same piece from multiple)
Write piece determining function
	- who to send pieces to


Write logger
	- look at the project description for details
